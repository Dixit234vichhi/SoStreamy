KnockoutJs, SignalR, and RavenDB Changes Api.

Think of this as a Twitteresque clone. You can deploy to a server and have people post messages. Messages are fleeting and will only be visible as long as you have your browser open. If you refresh they will be gone forever (not really).

You should be able to post messages and see them on your screen, and your friends should be able to see them as well in **REAL TIME**. This all works because of SignalR and the RavenDB Changes API. KnockoutJS makes it super easy to work with clients. I also have to give a shoutout to the cool and hip looking Flat-UI.

Requirements
-------------------

- Visual Studio 2012
